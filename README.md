# TestCopilot

## Running Tests

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set PYTHONPATH**:
    ```sh
    # On Windows
    set PYTHONPATH=%cd%\..

    # On macOS/Linux
    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/..
    ```

4. **Run Tests**:
    ```sh
    pytest tests/
    ```

### Troubleshooting

If `pip install -r requirements.txt` runs and nothing happens:

1. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated**:
    Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running the install command.

2. **Check Requirements File**:
    Ensure your `requirements.txt` file is correctly formatted and does not contain any invalid entries.

3. **Check Terminal Output**:
    Look at the terminal output for any error messages or indications of what might be going wrong.

4. **Run with Verbose Flag**:
    Run the install command with the `-v` (verbose) flag to get more detailed output:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt -v
    ```

5. **Check Python Version**:
    Ensure that the Python version in your virtual environment is compatible with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

6. **Check for Existing Installations**:
    Verify if the packages are already installed in your virtual environment:
    ```sh
    pip list
    ```

7. **Upgrade pip**:
    Upgrade pip to the latest version:
    ```sh
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

8. **Check for Network Issues**:
    Ensure that there are no network issues preventing pip from downloading the packages.

### Advanced Troubleshooting

1. **Check for Conflicting Packages**:
    Sometimes, package conflicts can cause issues. Check for any conflicting packages and resolve them.

2. **Clear pip Cache**:
    Clear the pip cache to ensure there are no corrupted files:
    ```sh
    pip cache purge
    ```

3. **Recreate Virtual Environment**:
    Delete the existing virtual environment and create a new one:
    ```sh
    # Deactivate the current virtual environment
    deactivate

    # Remove the existing virtual environment directory
    rm -rf venv

    # Create a new virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the new virtual environment
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Additional Steps

1. **Check the Content of `requirements.txt`**:
    Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file is correctly formatted and contains valid package names.

2. **Manually Install a Package**:
    Try installing one of the packages manually to see if there are any specific errors:
    ```sh
    pip install fastapi
    ```

3. **Check for Permissions Issues**:
    Ensure that there are no permissions issues preventing pip from installing the packages.
